      <p><b> This is my second sister. He love to wear like boy but she is obviously a girl. 
          Nah, everyone have their own taste in dressing. he look strict, but it was anassumption. 
          She is good and helpful. as her sister, we always rely on her. she is not study anymore because she said that study is boring. 
          So, she takes an alternatives to works. lucky her because her pocket money much from us. She 26 years old. even she is working right now, she also have her own dream.
          my parents and my family love her so much because she always the one who with us when we need someone. Thank you dear sister, love you.
